# Tour Plugin Documentation
## Introduction
The Tour plugin is a JavaScript plugin that provides a guided tour experience for users on a website or web application. It allows you to highlight specific elements on the page and display tooltips with relevant information or instructions.

# Installation
To use the Tour plugin, you need to include the required JavaScript and CSS files in your HTML document. You can include them using CDN (Content Delivery Network) links or by downloading the files and hosting them locally.
Here's an example of how to include the required files using CDN links:
htmlCopy code
<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta charset="UTF-8"> <title>Tour Plugin Example</title> <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"> <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.4.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@popperjs/core@2.9.2/dist/umd/popper.min.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.2/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script> <script src="tour.js"></script> </head> <body> <!-- Your HTML content here --> </body> </html> 

# Usage
To initialize the Tour plugin and create a guided tour, you need to call the formvalue function on a jQuery object.
Here's an example of how to use the Tour plugin:
javascriptCopy code
$(document).ready(function() { $().formvalue({ sequence: [ { element: "#element1", title: "Step 1", content: { text: "This is the first step of the tour.", btn_next: true, btn_previous: true, } }, { element: "#element2", title: "Step 2", content: { text: "This is the second step of the tour.", btn_next: true, btn_previous: true, } }, // Add more steps as needed ] }); }); 
In the above example, we pass an object with a sequence property to the formvalue function. The sequence property is an array of steps in the tour. Each step is defined as an object with the following properties:
•	element: The CSS selector of the element to highlight and display the tooltip.
•	title: The title of the step.
•	content: An object containing the content of the tooltip. It can include properties like text for the tooltip text and btn_next and btn_previous to control the display of next and previous buttons.

# Customization
The Tour plugin can be customized to fit your specific needs. You can modify the CSS styles of the tooltips and buttons to match your website's design. Additionally, you can adjust the timing and behavior of the tour by modifying the code in the plugin file.

# Conclusion
The Tour plugin provides an easy way to create guided tours on your website or web application. By highlighting specific elements and displaying tooltips, you can guide users through different steps and provide them with relevant information or instructions.
